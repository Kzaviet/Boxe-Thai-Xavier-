        <h2>Muay Thai History</h2>
        <p>Muay Thai, also known as " The Art of Eight Limbs, is a martial art that originated in Thailand. Its origins can be traced back to the 16th century. It was developed by Thai warriors who needed a form of effective close-combat technics. Muay Thai evolved through history to become a popular sport in Thailand and later worldwide.

        During the early 20th century, Muay Thai gained international recognition as Thai fighters began traveling to other countries to compete in various martial arts competitions. In the 1920s, the first official Muay Thai fights were held in Thailand, and the sport continued to grow in popularity both within and outside of the country. Today, Muay Thai is practiced worldwide and is recognized as one of the most effective striking-based martial arts. It continues to be a significant part of Thai culture, and Thailand remains one of the world's leading countries in producing top-level Muay Thai fighters.</p>
